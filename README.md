## About

A simple HTML project to practice HTML tags like H1, H2, ARTICLE, EM, and STRONG.

### Instructions

2. Start with the H1 tag and first P tag.
3. Add your own text about dogs in the H1 and P tags
4. Add EM and STRONG tags in the first P tag
5. Add an ARTICLE tag with an H2 and two P tags.
6. Add your own text in those tags. (You may use lorem ipsum)
7. (optional) Make another HTML file about a new topic that interests you. Include the ARTICLE, H1, H2, P, EM and STRONG tags.

### Bonus and Extension

You may choose to do a bonus or extension. These are optional activities that will help push your knowledge and skills further. Give them a try if you have the time!

**Bonus** (more tags): look at all [INLINE and BLOCK tags on w3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp). Which would be easy to use? Which are challenging? Choose a few to add as elements on your page.


**Extension** (deprecated tags): See: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML). Look for deprecated tags. Research why they are no longer used. Dig up the history behind why these tags fell out of use. Create a webpage of your findings using the deprecated tags and their replacements.
